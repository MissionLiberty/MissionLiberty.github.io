Congratulation, Argentina!

Here is a collection of disjointed fragments of an old song that's made for Milei:

![Don't tread on me argentina - Milei](/img/2023-11-20/dont-tread-on-me-argentina.png)

It won't be easy, you'll think it's strange
I had to let it happen, I had to change
Couldn't stay all my life down at heel
Looking out of the window, staying out of the sun
So I chose freedom
Running around, trying everything new
But nothing impressed me at all
I never expected it to

Don't tread on me argentina
Don't tread on me argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance
