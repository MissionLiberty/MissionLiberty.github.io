This week we watched the debate between [Yaron Brook](https://yaronbrookshow.com/) and [Bryan
Caplan](http://bcaplan.com/) debating the merits of anarcho-capitalism together.

Chairman of the Ayn Rand Institute Yaron Brook and George Mason University professor Bryan Caplan debate the resolution,
"Anarcho-capitalism would definitely be a complete disaster for humanity."

Taking the affirmative is Brook, host of The Yaron Brook Show. He was the Executive Director of The Ayn Rand Institute
from 2000 to 2017, and is now the Chairman of the Board. Brook has co-authored many books focused on capitalism and the
benefits of free markets: 'In Pursuit of Wealth: The Moral Case for Finance,' 'Equal Is Unfair: America's Misguided
Fight Against Income Inequality,' and 'Free Market Revolution: How Ayn Rand's Ideas Can End Big Government.' He was a
columnist at Forbes, and has been featured in the Wall Street Journal, USA Today, Investor's Business Daily and more.

Caplan, a Professor of Economics at George Mason University, is taking the negative. He's the New York Times Bestselling
author of 'The Myth of the Rational Voter,' 'Selfish Reasons to Have More Kids,' 'The Case Against Education,' and
more. He writes for the Substack Bet On It, and has been published in the New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street
Journal, Reason, and more.

# Event Report

The debate ended with Yaron winning the [Oxford-style debate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford-Style_debate).

In house, we have many people in support of the anarcho-capitalism also people who is in support of objectivism. The
debate was quite heated, but no animals were hurt during the process. The fair summary is:

- objectivists think by-definition capitalism must have the state to protect the rights of the property,
- while anarcho-capitalists believe the market and private contracts is sufficient to provide such protection,
- but we agree that we don't know if we agree or not agree on anything in the end ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.
