Vabaduse Tuba (“Freedom Room” in Estonian) is located in the heart of Tallinn, near the Vabaduse Väljak (“Freedom Square” in Estonian), the symbol of freedom and independence from authoritarian regimes.  
Vabaduse Tube share the same building where [Mises Institute Estonia](https://mises.ee/) is based.
