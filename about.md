“Mission: Liberty” is a _first-principles-driven organization_ for active people spreading the message of liberty.

The first principles that bind us together are:

* Misesian praxeology,
* Rothbardian/[Hoppean propertarianism](https://wiki.mises.org/wiki/The_Economics_and_Ethics_of_Private_Property),
* and Randian Objectivism Ethics.

The history of the organization dates back to [Mises Estonia](https://mises.ee/), where the Estonian expat [Miao](http://miaozc.me/) continued organizing 
events for from 2016 through [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/tallinn-libertarian-meetup/) and Facebook groups. 
After the pandemic, a few members of the groups decided to continue the activities as the separate initiative and named it “Mission: Liberty.”

The best way to join us is to join the [meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/tallinn-libertarian-meetup/) or send a email to [us](mailto:info@missionliberty.ee).
